// --- Implementation details ---

//
// # Safety
//
// As a type invariant, the inner pointer is assumed to always point to a valid
// fully built, non-aliased topology.
//
// Any binding to an hwloc topology function that takes a user-provided
// &TopologyObject parameter **must** check that this object does belongs to the
// topology using the Topology::contains() method before passing it to hwloc.
